## 💻 About Me
- 🎓 I’m building a solid foundation in computer science — from **data structures** to **operating systems**, **OOP**, and **algorithms**.
- 💡 I love turning abstract ideas into code — whether it’s a **C++/SFML game**, a **Spring Boot web app**, or a smart automation script in **Python**.
- 🔍 I enjoy solving tricky problems and making systems **modular, extendable, and clean**.
- ⚙️ I’m comfortable in both **Windows** and **Linux** environments, and I love diving deep into how things really work.
